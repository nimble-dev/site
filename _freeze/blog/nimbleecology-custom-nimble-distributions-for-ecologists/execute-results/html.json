When the package is loaded, these distributions are registered to NIMBLE and can be used directly in models.\n\nnimbleEcology contains distributions often used in modeling abundance, occupancy and capture-recapture studies.\n\n## Why use nimbleEcology?\n\nEcological models for abundance, occupancy and capture-recapture often involve many discrete latent states. Writing such models can be error-prone and in some cases can lead to slow MCMC mixing. We’ve put together a collection of distributions in nimble to make writing these models easier\n\n  * **Easy to use**. Using a nimbleEcology distribution is easier than writing out probabilities or hierarchical model descriptions.\n  * **Minimize errors**. You don’t have to lose hours looking for the misplaced minus sign; the distributions are checked and tested.\n  * **Integrate over latent states**. nimbleEcology implementations integrate or sum likelihoods over latent states. This eliminates the need for sampling these latent variables, which in some cases can provide efficiency gains, and allows maximum likelihood (ML) estimation methods with hierarchical models.\n\n## How to use\n\nnimbleEcology can be installed directly from CRAN as follows.\n    \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"nimbleEcology\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nOnce nimbleEcology is installed, load it using `library`. It will also load `nimble`.\n    \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(nimbleEcology)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nLoading required package: nimble\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nnimble version 1.3.0 is loaded.\nFor more information on NIMBLE and a User Manual,\nplease visit https://R-nimble.org.\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n\nAttaching package: 'nimble'\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nThe following object is masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    simulate\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nThe following object is masked from 'package:base':\n\n    declare\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nLoading nimbleEcology.

Are we missing a distribution you need? Let us know! We actively encourage contributions through GitHub or direct communication.\n\n## Example code\n\nThe following code illustrates a NIMBLE model definition for an occupancy model using nimbleEcology. The model is specified, built, and used to simulate some data according to the occupancy distribution.\n    \n    \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nocc_code <- nimbleCode({\n  psi ~ dunif(0, 1)\n  p ~ dunif(0, 1)\n  for (s in 1:nsite) {\n    x[s, 1:nvisit] ~ dOcc_s(probOcc = psi, probDetect = p,\n                            len = nvisit)\n  }\n})\n\nocc_model <- nimbleModel(occ_code,\n               constants = list(nsite = 10, nvisit = 5),\n               inits = list(psi = 0.5, p = 0.5))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nDefining model\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nBuilding model\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nSetting data and initial values\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nRunning calculate on model\n  [Note] Any error reports that follow may simply reflect missing values in model variables.\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nChecking model sizes and dimensions\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n  [Note] This model is not fully initialized.
