Weâ€™ve released the newest version of NIMBLE on CRAN and on our [website](https://r-nimble.org/). NIMBLE is a system for building and sharing analysis methods for statistical models, especially for hierarchical models and computationally-intensive methods (such as MCMC, Laplace approximation, and SMC).

This is a micro release that primarily addresses some packaging changes requested by CRAN. In addition, this release includes:

  * A multinomial MCMC sampler, `sampler_RW_multinomial`, for random variables following a multinomial distribution.
  * Some enhancements to error trapping and warning messages.
  * A variety of minor bug fixes.
