Weâ€™ve released the newest version of NIMBLE on CRAN and on our [website](https://r-nimble.org/). NIMBLE is a system for building and sharing analysis methods for statistical models, especially for hierarchical models and computationally-intensive methods (such as MCMC and SMC). Version 0.8.0 provides some new features, speed improvements, and a variety of bug fixes and better error/warning messages.

New features include:

  * a reversible jump MCMC sampler for variable selection via `configureRJ()`;
  * greatly improved speed of MCMC sampling for Bayesian nonparametric models with a `dCRP` distribution by not sampling parameters for empty clusters;
  * experimental faster MCMC configuration, available by setting `nimbleOptions(oldConjugacyChecking = FALSE)` and `nimbleOptions(useNewConfigureMCMC = TRUE)`;
  * and improved warning and error messages for MCEM and slice sampling.

Please see the [release notes](https://r-nimble.org/more/news) on our website for more details.
