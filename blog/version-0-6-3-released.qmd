Version 0.6-3 is a very minor release primarily intended to address some CRAN packaging issues that do not affect users. We also fixed a bug involving MCEM functionality and a bug that prevented use of the `sd()` and `var()` functions in BUGS code.

For most users, there is probably no need to upgrade from version 0.6-2.
