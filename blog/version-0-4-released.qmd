In late July we released a major new version of NIMBLE, 0.4. Ok, thatâ€™s still a low version number, indicating we have a lot we still want to build and improve, but this version can do a lot and is a huge step forward from 0.3. Almost everything runs faster, from model building to model and nimbleFunction compiling to compiled execution. New features include the ability to write your own functions and distributions for BUGS (as nimbleFunctions, of course) and an algorithm that automatically adapts blocks of correlated parameters for efficient joint sampling in MCMC.
