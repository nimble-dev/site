We’ve just released the next major version of NIMBLE.

Changes include

  * more efficient computations for conjugate sampling,
  * additional automated checking of BUGS syntax to improve NIMBLE’s warning/error messages,
  * new API functionality to allow the use of syntax such as model$calculate(), etc. (syntax such as calculate(model) still works),
  * new API functionality for MCMC sampler specification,
  * improvements in speed and memory use in building models,
  * addition of forwardsolve, backsolve, and solve to the NIMBLE DSL, and
  * a variety of other items.

More details in the NEWS file that accompanies the package.

We anticipate being on CRAN in coming weeks and a next release soon that will include a full suite of sequential Monte Carlo (i.e., particle filtering) algorithms.
