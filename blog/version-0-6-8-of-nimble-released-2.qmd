We’ve released the newest version of NIMBLE on CRAN and on our website a week ago. Version 0.6-8 has a few new features, and more are on the way in the next few months.

New features include:

  * the proper Gaussian CAR (conditional autoregressive) model can now be used in BUGS code as `dcar_proper`, which behaves similarly to BUGS' `car.proper` distribution;
  * a new `nimbleMCMC` function that provides one-line invocation of NIMBLE’s MCMC engine, akin to usage of JAGS and WinBUGS through R;
  * a new `runCrossValidate` function that will conduct k-fold cross-validation of NIMBLE models fit by MCMC;
  * dynamic indexing in BUGS code is now allowed by default;
  * and a variety of bug fixes and efficiency improvements.

Please see the NEWS file in the installed package for more details.
