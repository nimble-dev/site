We’ll be holding a half-day short course on NIMBLE on March 22 at the ENAR meeting in Nashville, Tennessee.

The annual ENAR meeting is a major biostatistics conference, sponsored by the eastern North American region of the International Biometric Society.

The short course will focus on usage of NIMBLE in applied statistics and is titled:

“Programming with hierarchical statistical models:  
Using the BUGS-compatible NIMBLE system for MCMC and more”

More details on the conference and the short course are available at the [conference website](https://www.enar.org/meetings/spring2020/index.cfm).
