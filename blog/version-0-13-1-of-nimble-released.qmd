Weâ€™ve released the newest version of NIMBLE on CRAN and on our website. This version is purely a bug fix release that fixes [a bug introduced in our new handling of predictive nodes in version 0.13.0](https://r-nimble.org/bug-in-newly-released-version-0-13-0-affecting-mcmc-for-models-with-predictive-nodes) (released in November). If you installed version 0.13.0, please upgrade to 0.13.1.
