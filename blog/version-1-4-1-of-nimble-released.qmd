We’ve released the newest version of NIMBLE on CRAN and on our [website](https://r-nimble.org/). NIMBLE is a system for building and sharing analysis methods for statistical models, especially for hierarchical models and computationally-intensive methods (such as MCMC, Laplace approximation, and SMC).

Version 1.4.1 is a micro release that primarily addresses some minor issues, but it also includes:

 - An MCMC sampler for sampling elements of partially observed multivariate normal random variables, e.g., if one has some elements of a data vector that are missing.
 - The ability to change the MCMC thinning interval when continuing an MCMC.

Please see the [release notes](https://r-nimble.org/release-notes.html) on our website for more details.
