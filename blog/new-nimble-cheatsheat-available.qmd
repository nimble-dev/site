We have prepared a cheatsheet that summarizes NIMBLEâ€™s functionality and syntax in a two-page format that follows the RStudio collection of cheatsheets. NIMBLE is a system for building and sharing analysis methods for statistical models, especially for hierarchical models and computationally-intensive methods (such as MCMC and SMC).

Please [see our documentation page](https://r-nimble.org/documentation) for a link.

Special thanks to Sally Paganin and Ben Goldstein for leading the development of the cheatsheet.
