Weâ€™ve released the newest version of NIMBLE on CRAN and on our [website](https://r-nimble.org/). NIMBLE is a system for building and sharing analysis methods for statistical models, especially for hierarchical models and computationally-intensive methods (such as MCMC and SMC). Version 0.9.0 provides some new features as well as providing a variety of speed improvements, better output handling, and bug fixes.

New features and bug fixes include:

  * added an iterated filtering 2 (IF2) algorithm (a sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) method) for parameter estimation via maximum likelihood;
  * fixed several bugs in our SMC algorithms;
  * improved the speed of MCMC configuration;
  * improved the user interface for interacting with the MCMC configuration; and
  * improved our conjugacy checking system to detect some additional cases of conjugacy.

Please see the [release notes](https://r-nimble.org/more/news) on our website for more details.
