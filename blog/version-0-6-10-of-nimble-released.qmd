We’ve released the newest version of NIMBLE on CRAN and on our website. Version 0.6-10 primarily contains updates to the NIMBLE internals that may speed up building and compilation of models and algorithms, as well as a few bug fixes.

Changes include:

  * some steps of model and algorithm building and compilation are faster;
  * compiled execution with multivariate distributions or function arguments may be faster;
  * data can now be provided as a numeric data frame rather than a matrix;
  * to run WAIC, a user now must set `enableWAIC` to TRUE, either in NIMBLE’s options or as an argument to `buildMCMC()`;
  * if `enableWAIC` is `TRUE`, `buildMCMC()` will now check to make sure that the nodes monitored by the MCMC algorithm will lead to a valid WAIC calculation; and
  * the use of `identityMatrix()` is deprecated in favor of `diag()`.
