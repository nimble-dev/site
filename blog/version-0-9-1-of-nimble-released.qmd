Weâ€™ve released the newest version of NIMBLE on CRAN and on our [website](https://r-nimble.org/). NIMBLE is a system for building and sharing analysis methods for statistical models, especially for hierarchical models and computationally-intensive methods (such as MCMC and SMC). Version 0.9.1 is primarily a bug fix release but also provides some minor improvements in functionality.

Users of NIMBLE in R 4.0 on Windows MUST upgrade to this release for NIMBLE to work.

New features and bug fixes include:

  * switched to use of `system2()` from `system()` to avoid an issue on Windows in R 4.0;
  * modified various adaptive MCMC samplers so the exponent controlling the scale decay of the adaptation is adjustable by user;
  * allowed `pmin()` and `pmax()` to be used in models;
  * improved handling of `NA` values in the dCRP distribution; and
  * improved handling of cases where indexing goes beyond the extent of a variable in `expandNodeNames()` and related queries of model structure.

Please see the [release notes](https://r-nimble.org/more/news) on our website for more details.
