Weâ€™ve just released version 0.4-1, a minor release that fixes some logistical issues and adds a bit of functionality to our MCMC engine.

Changes as of Version 0.4-1 include:

  * added an elliptical slice sampler to the MCMC engine,
  * fixed bug preventing use of nimbleFunctions in packages depending on NIMBLE, and
  * reduced C++ compiler warnings on Windows during use of compileNimble.
