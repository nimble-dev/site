We’ll be holding a in-person training workshop on NIMBLE, June 1-3, 2022, in Lisbon, Portugal, sponsored by the Centro de Estatística e Aplicações at the Universidade Lisboa (CEAUL).

NIMBLE is a system for building and sharing analysis methods for statistical models, especially for hierarchical models and computationally-intensive methods (such as MCMC and SMC).

More details and registration are available at the [workshop website](https://nimbleworkshop.weebly.com/). No previous NIMBLE experience is required, but the workshop will assume some familiarity with hierarchical models, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), and R.
