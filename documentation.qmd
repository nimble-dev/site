## Cheatsheet

- [The NIMBLE cheatsheet — a compact two-page overview and reference guide](NimbleCheatSheet.pdf).

## User Manual

- An [HTML version of the manual](manual/cha-welcome-nimble.html).
- A [PDF version of the manual](manual/NimbleUserManual.pdf).

The manual provides information for those wishing to use NIMBLE to work with their own models as well as algorithm developers wishing to write algorithms using NIMBLE. Old versions of the manual can be found [here](archived-versions-of-nimble-and-the-user-manual.qmd).

## Training materials

Please see our collection of [GitHub repositories with training materials](https://github.com/nimble-training) for materials from our various NIMBLE training workshops, including workshops developed for statisticans and workshops developed for ecologists.
