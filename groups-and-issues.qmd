## Groups

- We will post (occasional) announcements on the [nimble-announce](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/nimble-announce) Google groups site.

- We have an email list on the [nimble-users](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/nimble-users) Google groups site. This is intended for questions about NIMBLE, requests for new features, and other discussion of NIMBLE.

## Issues

Issues and bugs can be reported via the [issue tracker](https://github.com/nimble-dev/nimble/issues) of the nimble repository or via the [nimble-users](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/nimble-users) Google groups site. General "how to" questions are welcome. If reporting a problem, please provide a reproducible example. For compilation errors, please provide your operating system.
